# Fame of Thrones

Fame Of Thrones is a Game of Thrones Parody single-page social networking website designed on the basics of requisites for Harvard's CS50W's Project 4 - Network.


The site allows users to create their account by entering their email address and creating a username (subject to availability). Users can have a profile picture.


On the website, users can create posts which may contain image, text or both. They can like posts and follow other users through asynchronous API calls. An option to edit the posts is also provided. Users have a feed allocated for their followed content.


The website uses Javascript for client side operations and Django in python for server side operations. SQLite is used as database and a self-designed custom design system is followed. The font used throughout the site is Montserrat which is imported using Googl's API. Trojan Pro is another font used for Brand Name, which is imported from Adobe Fonts.
